        This is an example configuration file for a N:FC Dedicated Server.
        This configuration file is included with the default installation of the server and is 
        tracked by Steam's installation system.  If you modify it, it may be overwritten without
        warning.  It is recommended that you copy this file and give it a descriptive name.
        When starting your server, use the -serverConfig Path/To/File/MyServerConfig.xml argument
        to specify the config to use.
